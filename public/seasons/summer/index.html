  <h3 id="event-log-at-the-escapist-palace">Event Log at the Escapist Palace</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We sit on the precipice.<br>
Behind us the earth pushes forward—slowly, carefully,<br>
only when we aren&rsquo;t looking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On my back is a vortex, and the whole world enters in pairs.<br>
Two turkeys, two doe, two bucks, two babies,<br>
and the two of us, bewildered and searching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God lives in the ground here, and each of us knows this is true.<br>
We kiss it with whatever our mouth looks like today.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>    Mine: a hand opened, and head bowed.<br>
    Yours: gentle eyes that fall to your knees when the time is right.</p>
<p>    The time is always right. We hold hands and succumb in tandem.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>A million beds and we three still sit in the corner of one.<br>
We take turns dripping mirrors, checking if we’ve turned into our mothers yet,<br>
getting each other high, giving vigilante justice, and grace, and grace, and good god, grace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waist deep with danger swimming around my legs, I realize it no longer matters.<br>
The ocean crashes into me until my only thoughts are strategies for moving over, under, and through. My body is one with. There are no true minutiae. There never was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We lose the need for lists once encountered with the epiphany that order is for naught. Lights on a switchboard with no rhythm and never an end, you are a flash then nothing then everything in an instance. I am never afraid of the last time I see you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mourning is ingrained into our days, and we are thus jubilant.<br>
We welcome the end and brace for the beginning, over and over, knowing we will never coexist with the final conclusion and in that, we are melded together for finite forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We laugh at our own hurt feelings when the hummingbirds perform their dance.<br>
At their apex, our putrid insides roll away. We float into the emptied middle place where we have never been, and yet always are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no wildflowers because that is not the nature of this.<br>
The animals do not have enough to eat and houseless chimneys blink back at me—it is not about the beautiful end. It is surviving to the bitter one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We enter the houses of all strangers.<br>
We leave strands of our hair on pillows and in shoes.<br>
This is how you circumnavigate our new homes, and<br>
this is my desperate attempt for prolonged isolation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>     I want to be taken away forever.<br>
     I want to be stripped of my days and left at the mouth of rocky waters.<br>
     I want you to come, too.</p>
<p>     My exile will rebirth me, where will you be?</p>
<h3 id="a-day">A day</h3>
<p>Last night, I learned how to lucid dream,<br>
and we soared through the streets.</p>
<p>You still didn’t remember how much you meant to me,<br>
so I yanked us out and over to the moment,<br>
in which I never realized how uncomfortable<br>
my open heart surgery made you feel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<h3 id="another-day">Another day</h3>
<p>This morning, I woke up without anything to prove.<br>
I did some mulling over and didn&rsquo;t daydream about you,<br>
as another graduation, just today on my walk, as I do.</p>
<p>The trees gathered round me, to lean across the hall<br>
to touch each others spirit fingers, like parents<br>
after a middle school championship sports game won.</p>
<p>Today we celebrate the rain and<br>
how it made for a stream<br>
you cannot help but listen to.</p>
<p>The stride in my walk,<br>
the swing dance in my arms,<br>
the rushing, the onslaught, the<br>
washing over of contentedness.</p>
<p>The consummations of a lesson learned.<br>
The remembrance of the idle mind.<br>
The unsung fun of undemanded attention.</p>
<p>I ruined another idea by turning it into an Adderall sonnet today,<br>
an act of martrydom in the name of disjecta membra poetae</p>
<h3 id="you-infiltrator-of-premises-or-routine">you, infiltrator of premises or routine,</h3>
<p>i wanted  <br>
to write you<br>
a letter<br>
to say</p>
<p><em>how i think letters would make you happy<br>
which me, makes happy, and as would reading<br>
out loud. i always want to practice, and now you and<br>
yet now you. then now you. but now you. i have to read<br>
every love poem written to compare now holiest you<br>
to the stars  and then give it back. and now you. now<br>
you i have to reread all my old words to imagine now<br>
you imagining me, in a different life, begging<br>
to know my now you and i didn&rsquo;t even know of the <br>
breadth or the excitement and do you wanna make pasta?</em></p>
<p>i am threatened<br>
by abandon<br>
in every<br>
good way</p>
<h3 id="tell-me-youll">tell me you&rsquo;ll</h3>
<p>how happy you when<br>
we held hands to exit<br>
you felt like what maybe<br>
i daydream about tell me<br>
it was the best part tell me<br>
when you hear my name tell me<br>
what do you feel? you love my feet<br>
they&rsquo;re dirty but by no means unloved<br>
i&rsquo;m dirty i found it in my mom&rsquo;s search<br>
history of unlove they&rsquo;re dirty i am but i<br>
am un abashed loved by best contestant<br>
you? will you? try? they&rsquo;re calloused you<br>
don&rsquo;t mind. but i&rsquo;ve been places? could we try?</p>
<h3 id="exit-the-game">exit the game</h3>
<p>to turn hot blood into teenage angst and  alcohol<br>
requires at least all vulnerability left in the threads.</p>
<p>i don’t have it.</p>
<p>i don’t have the composure, the ability<br>
to withhold when you need it the most.</p>
<p>and so, congratulations:<br>
you broke down the flood barriers<br>
and I’m coming inside.</p>
<p>for a coffee, for a glass of wine,<br>
for appraisal, for a sleepover with</p>
<p>you tell me of skips in your step<br>
upon my name, witnessing it<br>
on me, witnessing it. on my being,<br>
witnessing it. and then you not of course</p>
<p>flee the scene, blame the floodgates<br>
rue them and remove them and remove<br>
you and ever having been the maybe happy<br>
ending. i&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>i got too excited. i can’t write like i once did or like  <br>
i expect but then maybe i expected you but can you<br>
blame me? i blame you, blame your idealization and<br>
devalue me because i gave in, because your fuck you<br>
removal. you wanna read my writing?<br>
i won&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>six months from now i will forget you<br>
unlike what you said it’d be<br>
six days from now i will forget you<br>
unlike some weekend plan with me</p>
<p>is it cuz i was barefoot?<br>
is it cuz of the chewed up gum?<br>
is it the drugs?</p>
<p>i’ll stop in the name of<br>
love but not yours</p>
