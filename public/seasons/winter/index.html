  <h1>Holidays, Grasping</h1>

  <h2 id="lies-i-tell-about-cancer">Lies I Tell About Cancer</h2>
<p>Today, I lied about picking my mother up from chemo<br>
but I wasn&rsquo;t lying about the chemo, my mom is dying,<br>
and so I have the right to lie<br>
(down in surrender, but please never let me)</p>
<p>My name is Hattie and I tell lies about cancer and I am afraid of driving because of crashing then dying but I tell others and myself that is not so&ndash; I say that my mother told me I was afraid, and so I was, and so I am.</p>
<p>Lies about cancer that I tell:</p>
<p>- I will be late because I am picking my mother up from chemo<br>
- Sometimes the best thing you can say is that you don&rsquo;t know what to say<br>
- I have found solace in the time that we still have left<br>
- I don&rsquo;t think about how long that time will last<br>
- I am not afraid</p>
<p>On my quietest days &amp; some alone nights,<br>
I think about when somebody told me that<br>
my personal problems (my cancer mom)<br>
did not absolve me from pain I&rsquo;ve caused<br>
<em>as if cancer has ever released me</em> or<br>
as if I cradle myself<br>
as if I could even bear to.<br>
It reminds me too much of my mother, and me,<br>
asleep somewhere inside the years between my birth<br>
and the first time I made her cry&ndash;<br>
somewhere safe that is no longer real,<br>
but somehow,<br>
I can still see me, cradled,<br>
and her, still able to hold me<br>
still able to protect me<br>
still my mother.</p>
<p>Still my mother, I become hers.<br>
Be still, I tell my mother and<br>
o, how we writhe in the pain<br>
of never talking about ours</p>
<p><em>Are there scholarly articles about the reversion to newborn vulnerability undergone by dying mothers?</em></p>
<p>My evidence suggests that eventually, the only thing they&rsquo;ll want to be<br>
is held and I just want to touch the side of her cheek softly<br>
but she hasn&rsquo;t succumbed — she will not<br>
admit how badly she needs tenderness.<br>
She will not succumb to being tender<br>
with even herself &amp; so neither will I,<br>
as that would mean surrendering to the beginning of the end<br>
and <em>who the fuck wants to imagine getting the last word?</em></p>
<p>After we both live forever, she will go out fighting,<br>
I will go out fighting, we will both go out fighting,<br>
and when the fight is over, after her dust &amp; drugs have settled,<br>
I will stand up again, and only then, alone,<br>
will I admit to needing my mother&rsquo;s love when I am weak</p>
<p>They say it wastes time to worry about when the day will be, but<br>
I think we waste the most time pretending that we are not afraid,<br>
that we are too strong to need a hand on our cheek<br>
<em>What do I do with my hands and this grief, mom?</em></p>
<p>If I am soft with myself<br>
amidst antemortem mourning,<br>
I will only see her face.</p>
<p>If I cry in surrender,<br>
I will only hear her voice.</p>
<p>And if I stop writing this poem<br>
to think about writing this poem,<br>
my face twists up and my chest implodes<br>
and everything gets real blurry because<br>
there are only visions of her still moving,<br>
and then one of her not,<br>
and then one of me not,<br>
and then there is nothing else.</p>
<h2 id="non-rom-com-reminders-of-a-love-so-absolute">Non Rom Com Reminders of a Love So Absolute</h2>
<p>the touch of love<br>
tenders my soul<br>
in the sweetest way, today</p>
<p>how often i am profoundly changed<br>
each time i am grounded</p>
<p>is it so scary to be absolutely loved?<br>
i want to be my best.</p>
<p>is it so scary to be loved absolutely?<br>
i look for it in other places.</p>
<p>what if i am not my best?<br>
you would still love me,<br>
and that hurts worse.</p>
<p>i want to be my best for you,<br>
i want to outgrow my growing pains,<br>
i want to love you through growth spurt hurt<br>
like you love me even when my hurt hurts you,<br>
[because, i am still growing]</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that you&rsquo;ve never stopped raising me<br>
and it&rsquo;s making me go blind—<br>
i see bright reds and muted pinks and sunshine yellows,<br>
i feel your solar warmth, your blinding brightness<br>
that burns my skin until it peels and i am left<br>
with this greyed baby blue, this waiting room purple,<br>
that paints and pours through my body,<br>
drowns me from the inside,<br>
consumes me whole,<br>
and spits me into the pit where [i now know]<br>
i must sit to assess the damages,<br>
to put the bones back together,<br>
to climb out and realize that the pit was a wall,<br>
that i am closer to the sun than ever<br>
that soon i will burn again.</p>
<p>do you remember when we went to the emergency room because a swimming pool reflection of the sun gave my hands burns that looked like tree trunks? it was so uncanny.</p>
<p>they gave me valium and i became so flippant<br>
that you pleaded me to never do drugs, which i did &amp; do<br>
which is okay because you did &amp; do more than me,<br>
which reminds me that i am a seed you planted, worked for, loved absolutely.</p>
<p>I am rooted in you and while I am not afraid of sneaky sunburns or opioid addiction,<br>
<em>I am afraid of my flippancy, and I am afraid of how it hurts you.</em></p>
<p>I want to outgrow my growing pains, but I cannot face my final fear.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>won&rsquo;t it feel so ridiculous when none of this ever comes true,<br>
to have fixated my renaissance upon loss?</em></p>
<h2 id="open-letter-on-corporate-grief">Open Letter on Corporate Grief</h2>
<p>infantile our dependence on foreign parental entities<br>
that forge motherhood and the totality of its governance,<br>
that forgo motherhood and the essential provision of self-concept—<br>
they tell us unlearned children could never know best,<br>
but wouldn&rsquo;t i need to ache tremendously and pick it all up<br>
in order to know what I cannot carry,<br>
in order to know how to hold</p>
<p>if you never teach a man to fish,<br>
if you never give him a fish,<br>
if you tell him there are fish as he lives in the desert,<br>
he is left at the mercy of your presentation,<br>
and then he will starve to death.</p>
<p>if the complexity of person-hood<br>
is as simple as maps, patterns,<br>
if it may be reduced to a row,<br>
if we may flux in or out of normalization<br>
if i do not earn my own trust, and neither do you,<br>
if intuition is better left programmed,<br>
will they know how many hours i&rsquo;ve logged,<br>
miscalculating my own dimensionality<br>
with the wrong measures?</p>
<p>the data analyst shown blueprints of success will surrender sleep<br>
trying to understand the distance between<br>
sought metrics and her best day<br>
and subsequently she will become blind<br>
to undertones and parallel lines due to<br>
the sleepless witness borne to others&rsquo; attainment<br>
of the key performance indicators set by corporate,<br>
such as:<br>
publicized CEO morning routines,<br>
rent-free twenty threes in a new york equinox class,<br>
unadulterated camcorder love,<br>
redemption arcs,<br>
shakespearean proclamations,<br>
trust fund manifestation,<br>
people in glass homes<br>
devoid of any artifact beyond ease</p>
<p><em>this is what we&rsquo;re running for?</em></p>
<p>is it actually self-actualization if it was never really yours?<br>
if I&rsquo;ve never experienced it, did i still see it with my own eyes?<br>
if i didn&rsquo;t see it with my own eyes, is it still part of my reality?<br>
do i get to make that choice?</p>
<p>i almost didn&rsquo;t remember<br>
that this is all i will ever be;<br>
self-definition through my lacking and my gaps<br>
is a perilous insult to the woman<br>
who writes this poem,<br>
to the day she arrived screaming,<br>
to the days / women that live in between<br>
and i almost didn&rsquo;t remember them because right now,<br>
i am struck dead at the hand of videos of hands, things<br>
being put away, people doing tasks / living lives that<br>
i do not recognize, claiming<br>
they have the way out but<br>
then being the way in, all<br>
while never having seen<br>
my foundation or<br>
living the days or<br>
being the women—<br>
a thousand parallel lines,<br>
how could they tell me<br>
to spend my life<br>
praying for our collision?</p>
<p>if we all fall asleep<br>
listening to the same distraction,<br>
will our dreams collide?</p>

<li>
<p>allowing the self to feel it all<br>
(self as inner child,<br>
the one that needed to shut up,<br>
and so now your voice roars in a way<br>
that makes you feel afraid)</p>
<p><em>and what if there is no recoil?</em><br>
we find it within ourselves, by repeating a rendition of an adult scream<br>
in our own voice, with those childlike promises of self-betterment<br>
(that really just ask: am i still a person worth loving?)</p>
<p>    tip:<br>
    answer &ldquo;YES, YES, YES&rdquo; your<br>
    whole way home, and cry:<br>
    for the joy of being so wholly loved,<br>
    for your homecoming</p>
<p>your chest<br>
must<br>
be cavernous,</p>
<p>it must be<br>
more<br>
than numb.</p>
<p><em>you shouldn’t want a drink.</em></p>
<p>it should feel so heavy that<br>
outpour is the only option for redemption<br>
and reclaim of light-footedness lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>perform rorscharch inkblot test.<br>
materials include:<br>
- paintings torn to shreds<br>
- drawings of (and letters to) ex boyfriends<br>
  that fill you with enough adoration to dig it up<br>
  and enough regret to drown yourself from the inside out,<br>
- paint that would not have dried<br>
  if your hands were actually meant for making<br>
- the willingness to search for answers,<br>
- and discomfort that you&rsquo;ve had them all along</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>look for all of your faces.<br>
trust that you see them,<br>
that others should see them, too</p>
<p>give them life even when they do not look like you<br>
(you are not always a degas subject)<br>
let them hold and behold each other,<br>
the cherub should ogle<br>
at the version of you with<br>
hands that belong to strangers</p>
<p>let them gouge your eyes out, and<br>
let them team up against you, and<br>
sit to talk it out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>listen to what is begging to be heard.<br>
you cannot live in past glory<br>
and make beautiful art.<br>
you must<br>
wash your face, give yourself space,<br>
you need<br>
allowance for, acceptance of<br>
your innards and the way<br>
your skin could never<br>
bleed like this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your feelings must be hurt.<br>
you must be vulnerable<br>
enough to get your feelings hurt,<br>
you must be brave enough<br>
to call hurt<br>
as you see it (old friend)</p>
<p>if it is easy,<br>
if they think they have felt it before,<br>
rip it up and<br>
start over.</p>
<p>turn off your ears,<br>
forget that other people have eyes.</p>
<p>they should squint to see the faces<br>
they should turn it upside down<br>
they should find the waldo and<br>
scream</p>
<p>your art must terrify you, or else<br>
you do not create for expression,<br>
you retell stories with endings that<br>
they have memorized</p>
<p>they should look at your art, point to your god, and<br>
only believe one revelation to be true. they should<br>
drown in the water of their own baptism and<br>
be rendered missionaries:<br>
has there ever been a deity to live inside of eye sockets?</p>

<p>i am supposed to write but<br>
i have nothing in me<br>
it isn’t you, any of you,<br>
except for the instance:<br>
i imagine your form outside of my home,<br>
and i no longer feel so alone.</p>
<p>i understand what it is like when this<br>
heart is in only my hands — i’ve written it to shreds,<br>
so much so that there are no remaining words, there is just<br>
my great love that no longer feels so parasitic.<br>
do i want for somebody to make a home of me?</p>
<p>i am supposed to write but<br>
i send you something in spanish<br>
about how afraid i am of being touched<br>
for reasons i don’t understand, for<br>
reasons i don’t understand, and<br>
you don’t speak spanish,<br>
y no quiero hablar sobre eso.</p>

<p>the game must be that: i reveal more about me,<br>
the bits nobody really actually wants to know, and<br>
i wait like some kind of hungry cat for you to<br>
<em>ask</em></p>
<p>but the game is slated to be a losing game, and<br>
i don’t tell you that, and<br>
i do that on purpose, and<br>
i pretend i prefer it that way.<br>
please, take the warnings and<br>
go</p>
<p>the next level of the game is:<br>
will i feel grotesque and<br>
will you make me feel dramatic<br>
just like my mom does?<br>
and will you think<br>
<em>of course you have issues with<br>
your mother, and of course<br>
you think your body has been violated<br>
because of course,<br>
there must be a reason that your<br>
hot young tight body<br>
cannot be touched</em></p>
<p>but back to me,<br>
and you would like to know,<br>
could you still fuck me?</p>
<p>i lose the game,<br>
i return to the previous page,<br>
you choose a different option</p>
<p>but then <br>
what if the space between us is negative<br>
and one of my legs, two aorta, a hand<br>
is at fusion with your respective appendages?<br>
what then?</p>
<p>what if you stare at me the wrong way?<br>
what if you sit in front of me and i don’t recognize you?<br>
even worse: what if you are exactly what i imagined?<br>
even better: what if you are exactly what i imagined?</p>

<p><em>monday night field notes on an evening of imagination: log of shapes found where they did not previously exist, undiscovered glaciers, new ways to measure time, and other observations made in a scheduled stupor at an infinite seven o clock</em></p>
<p>i am wearing a combination of my two favorite dresses &amp;<br>
all of the sudden it is my wedding dress</p>
<p>i do an irish jig,<br>
i melt into the floor.<br>
i am sinking,<br>
i won’t let go.<br>
it pulls me down,<br>
i never find who it is.</p>
<p>i am in bloom but it looks like imploding.<br>
something is skewing. we fall inside and then down.<br>
it loops through until the thought is right.<br>
it stops.</p>
<p>the tables no longer matter.<br>
the pages in front of me are<br>
lyrics about cosmic love.<br>
i remember i’ve memorized the song.<br>
i hide inside of cracks in the voice<br>
until it collapses under<br>
an atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>the lyrics become message drafts<br>
they’re texts that are still at work<br>
they’re spreadsheet analyses of orbit<br>
they’re lists of my worst qualities<br>
they justify my profligate,<br>
in both of our handwriting</p>
<p><em>the floor is lava, and we laugh it off like children</em></p>
<p>we erupt as hymen, stamen<br>
we play hooky inside the folds<br>
of velveteen petal curtains,<br>
as if we are still seeds.</p>
<p>i say that i don’t want to get caught defying mother nature.<br>
you tell me to jump.</p>
