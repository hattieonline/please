  <h1>Letters from Spring</h1>
  <p class="lead">writing, as an attempt to hold onto something, anything. </p>
  
</div>

<div class="col-6 content">
  <h2 id="depression-today-feels-like-a-homecoming">Depression, Today, Feels Like a Homecoming.</h2>
<p>I write you to confess that I&rsquo;m scared.<br>
I don’t know where it stops or starts,<br>
but I’m driving, and I’m in my way.</p>
<p>I write you to say I know nothing as ever.<br>
I write poetry about  my ascension before I can even begin.<br>
It adds more distance. I go deeper.</p>
<p>I write from something somehow lower.<br>
I am wrecked and begging.<br>
I am abandoned and I tolerate no noise.</p>
<p>I write to you from rock bottom.<br>
I write to you and I admit defeat.</p>
<p>The lump in my throat reaches a rolling boil.<br>
The clock stops pushing anything forward.<br>
My stomach sits me down for a talk:<br>
<em>I think I’ve been feeling a little depressed lately,</em>  I say to myself, smiling.</p>
<h2 id="the-matriarch-as-an-empty-home">The Matriarch as an Empty Home</h2>
<p>The life that flows in and out of a sometimes empty home<br>
the rearrangements the remodeling the notches in the door frame<br>
the capacity for cultivating life, the ardor<br>
the bookshelves, the heart in the center,<br>
the want for your strings pulled,<br>
for sleep in your old room.</p>
<p>A cultivation of my experiences, your experiences, our losses<br>
the ghosts of all the women, their wind through me, that<br>
people have died for this lineage— I sit with my shoulders back<br>
and with children that line my ribcage like birds.</p>
<p>When we cough too hard, the walls shake the blood out,<br>
and we are constantly borne anew.</p>
<h2 id="formal-inquiry-regarding-your-presence">Formal Inquiry Regarding Your Presence</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re back in a different form; I feel it in my neck hair.<br>
The apparition so in-my-face that I’m ashamed to write this poem.<br>
You and the abundant clarity on my need to abandon my feedback loop<br>
and I could cut the cord, but the promise of newness gives me the gift of release.</p>
<p>I want to take this smitten and allow myself to be slow, <br>
to respect the current moment, and not waste it on rehashing old ones.<br>
I wanted to write a love poem because I do it from a cloud, <br>
but then I send too many texts and tell myself I should have known.</p>
<p>So, I’m writing a note to say the bushes are teeming, <br>
and I love that I use that word— it’s dear, and I’m smart, <br>
and the silence lets me feel big. I fill the whole space <br>
it holds me in, and we hold our breath waiting, together.</p>
<p>I’m starting a new chapter and I promise<br>
I will value the process more than the result.<br>
It’s about what I want to say &amp; not what you could hear.<br>
It&rsquo;s the revelation that you have to be me now.<br>
I touch my cheek and  let all candles burn,<br>
recalling literature lessons where I am<br>
the listener and the speaker all at once</p>
<p>It scares me to write about what is not romantic, to add flourish to my fears.<br>
Note from tomorrow: only because it is scary to learn new things.</p>
<h2 id="letter-from-my-grandmothers-bedroom">Letter From My Grandmother’s Bedroom</h2>
<p>I write to you from the middle of a vortex.</p>
<p>We waltz around the kitchen and upstairs<br>
the woman I call my aunt now points<br>
at my bed and says <em>that’s where she slept</em>.</p>
<p><em>I hang my dresses with care, and put the best ones on display.<br>
She holds me in her arms.</em></p>
<p>Spring is upon us,<br>
so I’ve sprouted new roots.<br>
I’m tripping into summer &amp;<br>
giving birth to new truths.</p>
<p>My wingspan reaches outward,<br>
I’m scared of leaving your view.<br>
What if more space to blossom<br>
means growing apart from you?</p>
<p>My body slowly replaces itself<br>
and it&rsquo;s finally onto our jig,<br>
even my skin has noticed<br>
my insides have gotten too big.</p>
<p>I grow bigger branches that<br>
invite worse storms to weather.<br>
What when the new leaves let winter<br>
take on more loss than ever?</p>
<p>I mourn the life that grew with me<br>
and return it back to the earth,<br>
I pray that even the smallest spark<br>
ignites a massive rebirth.</p>
<p>Devout faith in my losses<br>
has led me to the holy land,<br>
where at last I paint self portraits<br>
that I’m able to comprehend.</p>
<p>When I excavate my undiscovered caverns<br>
to make room for cells with your name,<br>
I make new life throughout my body<br>
from the parts of you that remain.</p>
<h2 id="i-thought-i-was-like-the-universe-but-it-turns-out-im-not-that-small">I Thought I Was Like the Universe, but It Turns Out I’m Not That Small</h2>
<p>Firstly, forgive yourself<br>
for caving in a moment,<br>
and then forgive the moment<br>
for caving in at all.</p>
<p>Release the idea that biologically<br>
you were made for collapsing, and<br>
adopt the notion that biologically <br>
you were made for blossoming.</p>
<p>Your destruction is not <br>
sweeping restoration.</p>
<p><em>You are not the big bang.</em></p>
<p>Your resurrection  <br>
will still tomorrow <br>
reliably look like you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t grow like explosion,<br>
but like spring.<br>
You are a seed then a baby,<br>
then a bud then a blossom,<br>
and then you are dead again.</p>
<h2 id="incident-report">Incident Report</h2>
<p>I make art in fits of self-admonishment<br>
because I want to make art for you.</p>
<p>I send diagrams of cavernous regions,<br>
draw maps of where I hide vacant space,<br>
you cum inside me and we do not kiss,<br>
again.</p>
<p>Instead,<br>
you bring applesauce<br>
to my open, open door<br>
and spoon-feed me tastes<br>
of what it might feel like<br>
to be loved by you.<br>
Snooze the alarm five times,<br>
crawl back under,<br>
I am left in mourning,<br>
again.</p>
<p>On day of atonement,<br>
we have drinks at the same bar.<br>
I spend an hour doing and undoing my hair<br>
You tell me about a girl you’d like to marry,<br>
as if you are afraid I will forget I am not the end,<br>
again.</p>
