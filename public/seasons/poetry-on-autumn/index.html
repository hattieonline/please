  <h2 id="freytags-plot-pyramid-without-the-climax--especially-with-it">Freytag&rsquo;s Plot Pyramid Without the Climax &amp; Especially With It</h2>
<p><em>all who make love tonight are good poets</em><br>
but what of all 17 syllables i birthed with formal announcement<br>
to you, holiest, only to offer another's iambic offspring as<br>
my sacred sacrifice for the sake of<br>
letting you think i am more inspired<br>
than i am prolific than i am pregnable<br>
pregnant with a prayer that<br>
my third grade kiss satisfies<br>
your student your teacher our<br>
fight my fright your flight<br>
to your parents a sacrilegious fuck<br>
beyond my crooning or my arch or our arc<br>
who cares of the sloppiness or rightness of fellation<br>
except me and my rumination and exempt the girl<br>
i am at night as the daytime shift<br>
holds her head high but now yours low<br>
in the dark your words are reticent<br>
sunlit reverence maybe not made up<br>
maybe made up maybe made blurry by bibation maybe<br>
daydreams are clinical coping or maybe they're just dreams<br>
as ever since we / i poeticized this whatever it is<br>
i haven't slept before dawn in the early mourning<br>
of your probable preconceptions, i am clockwork awake<br>
and acquiescent to some guttural premonition<br>
that orchestrates my grief like a machinated head<br>
bowed at entr'acte, hanging low below the heart<br>
as if swelling could still be reduced or induced<br>
and mostly as if the exposition exposed enough<br>
to become a resolution with no resolve</p>
<h2 id="you-and-i-what-do-we-do">You and I, What Do We Do?</h2>
<p>morse code executed by electric existence<br>
mimicry of adult futures or whatever matrimony<br>
the back of your head and my loud door as dial tones<br>
for the poor reception where we sit, ladies in wait,<br>
men for lust or glory<br>
intrusion upon, open legs, pointed toes<br>
leaning back, all for the sake of our<br>
disinterested interest</p>
<p>i wrote poetry of her bad conversation and my<br>
rhythmic hallucinations and not<br>
of the first time we touch never<br>
our honest moments we don&rsquo;t<br>
talk about it there is no<br>
love to talk about, love i wait for<br>
you like to impress and here i am<br>
now what?</p>
<h2 id="we-probably-said-a-lot-of-weird-things">We Probably Said a Lot of Weird Things</h2>
<p>small white houses in<br>
which we raise kids on indie<br>
music and your whims</p>
<p>six figure mansions<br>
in the parts of town where all<br>
hip young parents live</p>
<p><em>my husband does law</em><br>
i&rsquo;d say from a white sundress<br>
translucent &amp; young</p>
<h2 id="not-sonnet-at-the-restaurant-with-the-waitress">Not Sonnet at the Restaurant With the Waitress</h2>
<p>not like i was eyecontacting anyways<br>
what would I be saying?<br>
&amp; what language will it be familiar to?<br>
is eveybody afraid of unknown integral cogs?</p>
<p>i have the right &amp; you don&rsquo;t<br>
now i tell myself i can&rsquo;t &amp; get on<br>
let down move on, tail-in-leggedly<br>
anger through can&rsquo;t be poetically on topical</p>
<p>typical of my self apologetical writhing<br>
about something done to somebody i knew once<br>
i repeat alone, lists of my most loved parts<br>
sold to you for tumoltuous sporatics</p>
<p>egging on my escapism from the sidelines<br>
like some shitty occasional step dad&ndash;<br>
do you like me expressive only conceptually?<br>
do you know when I dress up for you?</p>
<h2 id="ways-of-making-love">Ways of Making Love</h2>
<p>collapsedly, if it were a word<br>
it&rsquo;s a trap! think nothing fast— the world depends on it<br>
nuanced eye squints after i say that thing that i always do<br>
and winks of the like<br>
<em>desperately</em><br>
wound tight, appendage-wise<br>
as if you don&rsquo;t give a fuck who reads this poem<br>
as if  you&rsquo;ve never checked your work<br>
millimeters closer at a rate of one per second, so as to bit by bit collide into<br>
melt slowly in and reach a rolling boil<br>
ever so slightly, on the right side of my lower back, in passing<br>
we never feel embarrassed again<br>
letting silence in<br>
telling me not to get the arugula<br>
eating the arugula at the crux of rot<br>
please get the knot out of my back<br>
slowly,<br>
like a cartographer but<br>
as if this is our night shift<br>
wait more than 5 minutes for me,<br>
forcing me to take time<br>
with as many square inches of skin to skin contact as possible<br>
like we can&rsquo;t stop trying to recreate the fusion of two black holes or<br>
we just shouldn&rsquo;t— but i notice every morning when you didn&rsquo;t sleep well<br>
as if this can&rsquo;t be ever recreated: it&rsquo;s so bright, how could it possibly be described<br>
i will never have to try to make sense again in my life<br>
in a bathroom at a house party placebo-molly love-drunk<br>
pretending it was never about possession<br>
with our initials are etched on the love trees / whatever our hometowns have<br>
so tired but we can&rsquo;t <em>not</em><br>
following a mutually shared accomplishment<br>
lazily<br>
in hourly intervals  on the brightest day of the year,<br>
just to spite<br>
roleplaying Irish exits<br>
on the holidays we forget we have off<br>
like we know the same thing<br>
we&rsquo;re partners in a card game about to play the hand of a lifetime<br>
thinking maybe you&rsquo;ve never felt anything like this, but<br>
you know exactly what to do,<br>
and actually i know what to do too, but i&rsquo;m acting a little nervous (and i am)</p>
<h2 id="governance-over-the-girl">GOVERNANCE OVER THE GIRL</h2>
<p>MY COMEBACK MY<br>
NEVER CUMMING<br>
MY EYE CONTACT &amp;<br>
AVERSION<br>
MY RATTLING<br>
MOUTH MY<br>
WEED DEPENDENCY<br>
MY SHITTY<br>
BEER MY<br>
MOTHER'S NERVES<br>
MY FATHER'S NOSE<br>
MY DECORATIVE<br>
MEANINGLESS CREATIONS<br>
MY UNDISCOVERED GLACIER<br>
&amp; YOUR THIEVING HANDS</p>
<p>MY SELF-CENTERED<br>
WORLD WHERE I<br>
PUT MYSELF FIRST<br>
AT THE RISK OF<br>
YOUR DISPLEASURE<br>
&amp; THE LOSS OF MY NEED<br>
TO AFFIRM MY RIGHTNESS<br>
THROUGH YOUR EYES</p>
<p>MY FOWL NEED FOR SECURITY<br>
&amp; MY ENDEARING FOWL MOUTH<br>
&amp; THE FACT THAT I BUY FLOWERS<br>
IN MY BEST DRESSES &amp; THAT<br>
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE SOMEBODY<br>
TO MY FRIENDS &amp; DON'T HAVE SEX<br>
FAST ENOUGH &amp; HAVE SEX TOO<br>
FAST &amp; HAVE SEX TOO LOUD &amp;<br>
NOT HAVE SEX AND JUST LAUGH.</p>
<p>I DECIDE I AM MY JUDGE &amp;<br>
THEY CORRAL AROUND ME<br>
AGAPE BEGGING TO BE<br>
MY JUDGE AGAIN AS IF<br>
I SHOULD NOT BE THE JUDGE<br>
OF MY STILL FOREIGN BODY</p>
