  <h2 id="september-18th-2021">September 18th, 2021</h2>
<p>i'd prefer to meet the sun before it meets me first and<br>
i'd like to stand beneath it, warm summer-like and coolly say:</p>
<p><em>so imagine we're you-and-i-whispering to each other about</em><br>
<em>something or other, maybe god, but at least devout luckiness</em></p>
<p>i'd prefer not to care how i write my poetry<br>
it's like i'm talking myself into a flow state immersive<br>
o, pour from my pen / no my type /<br>
is it because i type that i cannot muster<br>
a poetic anything? or, conversely</p>
<p>who am i to say that anything is or is not poetic because poetry is</p>
<p>when i stand beneath a world that towers over me,<br>
there is a feeling i've never felt and at this point<br>
i've felt it enough to know that i can feel it again&ndash; i've never not.<br>
growing up within temporality the trees grew next to me<br>
but now there is a new place with tree roots of transmutation<br>
forcing streets into hills pillaging cracks in sidewalks<br>
these trees are so assertive—</p>
<p><em>can they teach me how or have i not come of age yet?</em></p>
<p>throw my own debutante ball on the self-designated cleaning day<br>
i stand in my best dress, study myself poised in the mirror, and i let my<br>
pencil do all of my talking— o how stern and stoic i look.</p>
<p><em>have i aged a bit?</em></p>
<p>there are hurricanes in the north east people wade or boat for<br>
their daily commute the breeze reaches here too with white water<br>
that explodes down the street as if an airport homecoming con roses<br>
pour like greeting an old friend ready to attach the hip to the other water bits<br>
&quot;i've missed you since we were in that cloud, has anything changed at all? &quot;</p>
<p><em>do i miss being part of something bigger than me?</em><br>
<em>have i ever been a part of anything bigger than me until now?</em></p>
<p>rebirth seems to have everything to do with the atomic level of being or not being:<br>
&quot;a spark, a particle of old fire, bursts to life again ferociously enough to consume a whole house&quot; or &quot;a flood reminds us that rebirth begins with nurturing even the smallest bits of matter&quot;</p>
<p>oppuestos attract or there is no rebirth without burning it all down<br>
letting fire consume everything and never extinguishing not until nothing remains<br>
once thy home is hollowed, queue the outpouring the onslaught the everything<br>
there is no renewal of what was— just a final blow that knocks the rest<br>
and the wind out and we shall be left to put the no remaining pieces<br>
back together as kintsugi and we shall form with our hands new ways to succumb to<br>
from the untouched scorched fertile giving ground that is<br>
just ours nobody else's just ours to decide how to plan this us city&ndash;<br>
i make my own unflawed humanity that kisses me back &amp; makes mistakes,<br>
for whoever just realizes there doesn't have to be another side to anything<br>
some things can just be, and that is the end, and still just the beginning</p>

<p>WHAT I DID TODAY</p>
<hr>
<p>i did cut my hair bit by bit<br>
sometimes how i was supposed to but usually not<br>
so as to not cut my fingers in the shapes of split ends</p>
<p>i did cut the back myself, it was hard<br>
so then i let myself feel tired.<br>
i indulged some kind of whim<br>
which reminded me of whim still living<br>
in the forgettable elsewhere of the everyday</p>
<p>i made a mean foccacia and my personal best alfredo sauce</p>
<p>i did sit in the rain and<br>
i did realize later that what was actually happening was that i was sad<br>
but at the time i thought the poem about a mother and her daughter<br>
was what moved me to tears and<br>
you can&rsquo;t feel good forever and<br>
life does humbly remind me of that.</p>
<p>i did beg for creation and i did try for it<br>
but sometimes there are days that i reread my last moments of ascention<br>
cuz i&rsquo;m deperate to remember how i climbed without realizing it<br>
until i was stuck atop something - i&rsquo;d like to keep meeting myself<br>
where i left off but i realize that is not feasible and that you know -<br>
paths, newness, amnesia, all of it</p>
<p>i did say nothing to some sometimes for some time<br>
i&rsquo;ve got this pivot project where i listen to only the bus<br>
wade through that which i am knee deep in (<br>
rain) reminds me that i too can weep and then i do<br>
and i won&rsquo;t stop until it does but even still<br>
i love it like source or mother<br>
as if it gives the permission slip for exploration by extraction-<br>
dig up something or all inside me &amp; let it be washed<br>
and after that, most importantly<br>
i learned that i too can catalyze rebirth,<br>
and then i could not sleep again, the rain kept going</p>

<p>WHAT I DID TODAY</p>
<hr>
<p>i did not run out of things to say<br>
i did not feel sad in the same way<br>
but today: rambunction like sons or pining</p>
<p>i did gorge (daintily) i'm sorry, i secretly and wholly devoured:<br>
1. two different gas-station-esque snacks in loud bags past 11PM<br>
   <em>could anybody hear?</em><br>
2. my own words mostly cuz i proposed that you eat my shorts / me,<br>
   and all that blush for what? inspiration that hopefully carries me outta<br>
         <em>my fingers are still crossed</em><br>
         <em>Emily is coming over tonight and</em><br>
         <em>don't forget Kate has her presentation tomorrow</em><br>
   this place with its sudden mold and stalagmite half empties<br>
   which at least is now recognizable &amp; furthermore i understand the mechanics</p>
<p>i considered the men and then you and then you again but what might be better<br>
[after self-consideration] is to remind me more of my father please<br>
not all-knowing Dionysus but he who was before i<br>
think he used to create all prolifically undone and probably was kind, he<br>
today loves me in the best way i or anyone could- something like that please</p>
<p>oh and i showered! unlike ever before as if porously or gutted (good) or like<br>
all of the dumb poems about you me &amp; catharsis have been wrong (better)</p>
<p>it stormed and my radishes got fucked and get this, you won't believe it:<br>
four armed teenagers took both the corner &amp; the cars by storm and despite that,<br>
i called ceasefire on my sleep strike, 2-week streak aside, because i suppose<br>
i do probably want to feel good<br>
and i do</p>
<p>i promised my mom that i'd call before bed<br>
but then decided maybe i'd rather see her instead<br>
because i thought too much about semantics &amp; death<br>
so i followed her advice &amp; i practiced my breath<br>
i did as she does and worried myself sick,<br>
matrifocal dawn turned sorry soporific</p>
<h2 id="september-23rd-2021">September 23rd, 2021</h2>
<p>WHAT I DID TODAY</p>
<hr>
<p>i do not want to write a poem<br>
i want to work and clean and think about fall fashion<br>
but i also want to do this project,<br>
and so, here is what is today:<br>
it is chilly and my apartment feels different,<br>
my therapist told me i am not codependent<br>
yesterday i cleaned two rooms&ndash; it feels amazing,<br>
and like all adults do, i loved morning meeting.<br>
i feel good &amp; happy with myself</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>it is now 6:50 PM and i have been rejected twice today.<br>
both of them were okay, neither made me sad like you'd think<br>
on both occasions i loved myself more and never once felt ugly.<br>
i could even say i feel empowered in being turned down,</p>
<p>but now it is very quiet, and i know i'm not sad,<br>
but my heart feels a little in my stomach,<br>
and i'm not sure why</p>
<p>it feels like i should be doing something social<br>
since we're all so excited about the weather<br>
classic days of plans with no plans feel wrong and<br>
i am out of paper towels but i already came and went from CVS<br>
do i need them? what do i need? maybe rich homie quan and half of an adderall<br>
maybe not the adderall but to at least feel fun so is that a shower? noodles?<br>
kitchen has to clean first before dinner. what dinner? what paper towels?<br>
i got a dashboard project today that i've wanted for over a year,<br>
did my makeup during the meeting, and took a golden mirror from the street.<br>
a lot of good walking today which explains my reluctance to get paper towels<br>
wouldn't i have just jumped on that walk usually? that's ok.</p>
<p>i can't be all of the things on all of the days.<br>
but i will be, and am, thankful that i'm at least doing this thing on this day</p>
<p>my mom called<br>
and her voice sounded small<br>
i know she wants to come be with me<br>
but i just sit and stall</p>
