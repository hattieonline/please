  <h2 id="i-lie-about-cancer-and-ill-keep-fucking-going">I Lie About Cancer and I’ll Keep Fucking Going</h2>
<p><em>i&rsquo;m so volatile</em><br>
  that my concrete tragedy<br>
  is easier for you to digest<br>
  than the tumorous nothing<br>
  that i’m growing in my hands<br>
<em>that the oncologist thinks it moved into the brain</em></p>
<p><em>i&rsquo;m so dramatic</em><br>
  but if i don&rsquo;t give pain as performance<br>
  it could never be sensational art.<br>
  i’d be left at the mercy of your empathy, and</p>
<p><em>for your consideration:</em><br>
  i grew up as her constant<br>
  embarrassment because<br>
  i cried on every last day</p>
<p>  self portraits of<br>
  my writhing lined our walls<br>
  only after winning awards</p>
<p>  i only win when my loss<br>
  is something they can hold</p>
<p>i lie because cancer demands more respect than me<br>
     because it always fights back,<br>
     and it never knocks out</p>
<p>i lie because everybody understands, and <br>
     what if you don’t believe me?<br>
     what if you don’t take the time?</p>
<h2 id="man-seeking-hot-young-passion-project">Man Seeking Hot Young Passion Project</h2>
<p>Withholding as punishment for absence<br>
is a vast miscalculation of my weakest spots.</p>
<p>If you were so ivy league,<br>
you’d not throw your overpower<br>
into complaints for compliance—<br>
<em>I’d just be there.</em></p>
<p>I am too old to follow anger home.<br>
I am too old to feign naiveté.</p>
<p>If you saw me in three dimensions, you’d run and I’d laugh.</p>
<p>I’m so strong that it would make you fucking blind.<br>
I’m so strong that I won’t show you.<br>
I’m so strong that I throw a little fit when you put me down.<br>
I’m so strong that I only silently collapse.<br>
I’m so strong that I shave my stomach and my asshole.</p>
<p>I’m so strong that I laugh when you want to buy me Invisalign,<br>
and force me to smile with only my good teeth.</p>
<h2 id="tips-and-implores-for-cessation-and-support">Tips and Implores for Cessation and Support</h2>
<p>For valentines, please<br>
remind me that nobody<br>
can hear me eat.</p>
<p>For valentines please,<br>
tell me you’re playing<br>
the game with me, too.</p>
<p>For valentines please,<br>
kiss my mother wound <br>
and pour vodka inside.</p>
<p>They act like I push her away,<br>
but she’s the one who won’t be my mother.</p>
<p>My sister blacked out on three beers and asked<br>
why I don’t love our maker enough<br>
to see her as a person first.<br>
I cried, and I don’t know why,<br>
maybe because of nicotine withdrawal.</p>
<p>She asked if I would tell anyone<br>
if she drank and drove, and<br>
I told her I wouldn’t.<br>
My cousin picked us up,<br>
our parents brought chinese,<br>
she wouldn’t let dad give me a cigar.<br>
I went home and got high.<br>
I slept from 7-2.</p>
<p>I wish I had moved with more grace.<br>
I’m sorry.</p>
<h2 id="almost-sonnet-on-the-alternate-universe-in-which-i-am-unfazed-by-infrequent-ire">Almost Sonnet on the Alternate Universe in Which I Am Unfazed by Infrequent Ire</h2>
<p>I have this vision at a bathroom sink<br>
finally clean after hiding for weeks<br>
my box opened up and my sins fell out<br>
the anger I feared flew into my mouth</p>
<p>anger is the law, the  law is the land<br>
all injustice has been done by my hand<br>
and most of all what I cannot look past<br>
is how loved I am despite being crass</p>
<p>and o how unearthed is my makers&rsquo; pain<br>
the accidental crux of my disdain<br>
I stand in the mirror and curse my eyes<br>
what if I look away &amp; you know I cried?</p>
<p>a forced stoic on the day of atonement<br>
testing myself against weather’s omen<br>
I melt as they discover my menace<br>
no release until I leave with penance</p>
<p>attempt resilience in calamity<br>
with undeserved prayers for your amnesty</p>
<h2 id="dreaming-in-allegory-kinda">Dreaming in Allegory, Kinda</h2>
<p>i had a dream last night<br>
that i had all the answers<br>
and i was brave enough to ask</p>
<p>we were back at the beginning.<br>
you were there, and so were you<br>
the water was still,<br>
and everybody knew<br>
it has all led to this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure where we were, there was nothing<br>
there were no years. dirt, maybe, and<br>
we took turns holding each other for days,<br>
as if we still had them. our stomachs landed,<br>
there were no games, no nuances, no walls</p>
<p>i miss you, and you, and<br>
i&rsquo;m not sure what loss is teaching me<br>
beyond fruition and futility</p>
<h2 id="love-is-predicated">Love Is Predicated</h2>
<p>My love language:<br>
zit dots &amp; patches,<br>
making myself small,<br>
pushing myself to anger<br>
until maybe you&rsquo;ll call,</p>
<p>the clean slate, the forgiveness,<br>
the UTIs, and the distance;</p>
<p>I don’t answer <em>her</em> calls<br>
because I’m high and I’m<br>
scared she knows I’ve spent<br>
all my money and this is not<br>
a poem it’s an assessment:<br>
where do I feel it in my stomach?</p>
<p>I almost let myself cry in therapy,<br>
Debra was gonna mother me.<br>
I won’t let her, I won’t let anyone&ndash;<br>
I’ll just keep being the baby. No, I won’t.<br>
I&rsquo;m in charge of my actions and I’m right.</p>
<p>And I did all of this to myself, but I’ve been hurting.<br>
<em>Admitting that never feels less painful</em>.</p>
<p>What are parents supposed to do with a sad child?<br>
Tell it to stop?</p>
