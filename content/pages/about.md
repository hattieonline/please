### Happiness is holding a flower in each hand.

Hattie Sager is comprised of springtime peonies and late summer's dahlias. She can be found walking to grocery stories, pushing her shoulders back,
engaging in martyrdom, and being loved in return. 

When asked to sing, she cries. When asked to cry, she holds. When asked to hold, she runs. 
When asked to run, she walks. When asked to walk, she always says yes.  

She enjoys frequently forgetting to study the greats, bringing a book of sonnets with her 
every time she leaves the  house, and especially matching pajamas. Most people believe her kind. Some people wish her dead. She likes to be alone. She gets high and walks 
in circles. She is afraid of her mistakes.

### And what does she dream of?

She dreams in schematics, in conditional coding statements, with logic and abandon. In both dreams and waking, she is not sure if she has time. 
In dreams and not waking, she is unafraid of exploration. In waking but not dreams, she doesn't say anything when she sees you, years later, at a bar. She does this to be nice.
She does not dream nicely.
