i am rebirth of new seasons    
i am pitcherfull of sweet       
i am an unmelting snowflake  
that may thursday meet  

mister hide out  
and at it again  
pretending he likes me  
in front of his friends   

fine tuned possession  
lives one day at a time  
for my silent lysistrata  
my unannounced rhyme
