the way you draw a face  
passed down  unto  
mine: drawn like a graph    
not passed down, i should   
clean and fold and check my  
bank account daily, i'm again   
overdrawn or drowning. yes  
terday i asked for your help   
slowing down. today i found you  
mourning in a lowes, we hold each   
other in an instance: a joke about fruit flies    
from a false kitchen we do not recognize.   
i turn bud light into water, jesus  
christ how often, but  
it only matters how much.  
sorrow is less about frequency  
and more about fear of touch  
we remember the intensity,  
we are haunted by the rush.  
your best american girl lives  
on through her dad's eyes:    
terrified of his weakness,  
chasing down his pride
