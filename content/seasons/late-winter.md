## I Lie About Cancer and I’ll Keep Fucking Going
_i'm so volatile_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;that my concrete tragedy  
&nbsp;&nbsp;is easier for you to digest  
&nbsp;&nbsp;than the tumorous nothing   
&nbsp;&nbsp;that i’m growing in my hands  
*that the oncologist thinks it moved into the brain*

*i'm so dramatic*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;but if i don't give pain as performance  
&nbsp;&nbsp;it could never be sensational art.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;i’d be left at the mercy of your empathy, and

*for your consideration:*   
&nbsp;&nbsp;i grew up as her constant   
&nbsp;&nbsp;embarrassment because  
&nbsp;&nbsp;i cried on every last day

&nbsp;&nbsp;self portraits of   
&nbsp;&nbsp;my writhing lined our walls   
&nbsp;&nbsp;only after winning awards

&nbsp;&nbsp;i only win when my loss  
&nbsp;&nbsp;is something they can hold


i lie because cancer demands more respect than me  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because it always fights back,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it never knocks out  

i lie because everybody understands, and    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what if you don’t believe me?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what if you don’t take the time?

Withholding as punishment for absence  
is a vast miscalculation of my weakest spots.

If you were so ivy league,   
you’d not throw your overpower   
into complaints for compliance—   
_I’d just be there._

I am too old to follow anger home.  
I am too old to feign naiveté.

If you saw me in three dimensions, you’d run and I’d laugh.

I’m so strong that it would make you fucking blind.   
I’m so strong that I won’t show you.  
I’m so strong that I throw a little fit when you put me down.  
I’m so strong that I only silently collapse.  
I’m so strong that I shave my stomach and my asshole. 

I’m so strong that I laugh when you want to buy me Invisalign,  
and force me to smile with only my good teeth.

## Tips and Implores for Cessation and Support

For valentines, please  
remind me that nobody  
can hear me eat.

For valentines please,  
tell me you’re playing  
the game with me, too.

For valentines please,  
kiss my mother wound    
and pour vodka inside.

They act like I push her away,   
but she’s the one who won’t be my mother.

My sister blacked out on three beers and asked  
why I don’t love our maker enough  
to see her as a person first.  
I cried, and I don’t know why,   
maybe because of nicotine withdrawal.

She asked if I would tell anyone   
if she drank and drove, and   
I told her I wouldn’t.   
My cousin picked us up,   
our parents brought chinese,   
she wouldn’t let dad give me a cigar.   
I went home and got high.   
I slept from 7-2.  


I wish I had moved with more grace.  
I’m sorry.


## Almost Sonnet on the Alternate Universe in Which I Am Unfazed by Infrequent Ire
I have this vision at a bathroom sink  
finally clean after hiding for weeks  
my box opened up and my sins fell out  
the anger I feared flew into my mouth

anger is the law, the  law is the land  
all injustice has been done by my hand  
and most of all what I cannot look past  
is how loved I am despite being crass

and o how unearthed is my makers' pain  
the accidental crux of my disdain  
I stand in the mirror and curse my eyes  
what if I look away & you know I cried?

a forced stoic on the day of atonement  
testing myself against weather’s omen  
I melt as they discover my menace  
no release until I leave with penance

attempt resilience in calamity  
with undeserved prayers for your amnesty  


## Dreaming in Allegory, Kinda

i had a dream last night  
that i had all the answers  
and i was brave enough to ask

we were back at the beginning.  
you were there, and so were you  
the water was still,   
and everybody knew  
it has all led to this

i'm not sure where we were, there was nothing  
there were no years. dirt, maybe, and  
we took turns holding each other for days,   
as if we still had them. our stomachs landed,  
there were no games, no nuances, no walls

i miss you, and you, and  
i'm not sure what loss is teaching me  
beyond fruition and futility

## Love Is Predicated
My love language:   
zit dots & patches,  
making myself small,  
pushing myself to anger  
until maybe you'll call,  

the clean slate, the forgiveness,  
the UTIs, and the distance;  

I don’t answer _her_ calls  
because I’m high and I’m  
scared she knows I’ve spent  
all my money and this is not  
a poem it’s an assessment:  
where do I feel it in my stomach?

I almost let myself cry in therapy,  
Debra was gonna mother me.  
I won’t let her, I won’t let anyone--  
I’ll just keep being the baby. No, I won’t.   
I'm in charge of my actions and I’m right.  

And I did all of this to myself, but I’ve been hurting.   
_Admitting that never feels less painful_.

What are parents supposed to do with a sad child?  
Tell it to stop?
