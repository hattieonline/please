## Depression, Today, Feels Like a Homecoming.



I write you to confess that I'm scared.  
I don’t know where it stops or starts,  
but I’m driving, and I’m in my way.  

I write you to say I know nothing as ever.  
I write poetry about  my ascension before I can even begin.  
It adds more distance. I go deeper.  

I write from something somehow lower.  
I am wrecked and begging.   
I am abandoned and I tolerate no noise.   

I write to you from rock bottom.  
I write to you and I admit defeat.  

The lump in my throat reaches a rolling boil.  
The clock stops pushing anything forward.  
My stomach sits me down for a talk:   
_I think I’ve been feeling a little depressed lately,_  I say to myself, smiling.  


 ## The Matriarch as an Empty Home

The life that flows in and out of a sometimes empty home  
the rearrangements the remodeling the notches in the door frame  
the capacity for cultivating life, the ardor  
the bookshelves, the heart in the center,  
the want for your strings pulled,   
for sleep in your old room.

A cultivation of my experiences, your experiences, our losses  
the ghosts of all the women, their wind through me, that  
people have died for this lineage— I sit with my shoulders back  
and with children that line my ribcage like birds.

When we cough too hard, the walls shake the blood out,  
and we are constantly borne anew.

## Formal Inquiry Regarding Your Presence

You're back in a different form; I feel it in my neck hair.  
The apparition so in-my-face that I’m ashamed to write this poem.  
You and the abundant clarity on my need to abandon my feedback loop   
and I could cut the cord, but the promise of newness gives me the gift of release.  

I want to take this smitten and allow myself to be slow,    
to respect the current moment, and not waste it on rehashing old ones.  
I wanted to write a love poem because I do it from a cloud,    
but then I send too many texts and tell myself I should have known.   

So, I’m writing a note to say the bushes are teeming,    
and I love that I use that word— it’s dear, and I’m smart,    
and the silence lets me feel big. I fill the whole space    
it holds me in, and we hold our breath waiting, together.     

I’m starting a new chapter and I promise   
I will value the process more than the result.  
It’s about what I want to say & not what you could hear.  
It's the revelation that you have to be me now.  
I touch my cheek and  let all candles burn,  
recalling literature lessons where I am   
the listener and the speaker all at once  

It scares me to write about what is not romantic, to add flourish to my fears.   
Note from tomorrow: only because it is scary to learn new things. 


## Letter From My Grandmother’s Bedroom 

I write to you from the middle of a vortex.  

We waltz around the kitchen and upstairs  
the woman I call my aunt now points  
at my bed and says _that’s where she slept_. 

_I hang my dresses with care, and put the best ones on display.	  
She holds me in her arms._


Spring is upon us,  
so I’ve sprouted new roots.  
I’m tripping into summer &  
giving birth to new truths.  

My wingspan reaches outward,  
I’m scared of leaving your view.   
What if more space to blossom   
means growing apart from you? 

My body slowly replaces itself   
and it's finally onto our jig,   
even my skin has noticed  
my insides have gotten too big.   

I grow bigger branches that  
invite worse storms to weather.   
What when the new leaves let winter   
take on more loss than ever?  

I mourn the life that grew with me   
and return it back to the earth,   
I pray that even the smallest spark   
ignites a massive rebirth. 

Devout faith in my losses  
has led me to the holy land,  
where at last I paint self portraits   
that I’m able to comprehend. 

When I excavate my undiscovered caverns   
to make room for cells with your name,   
I make new life throughout my body   
from the parts of you that remain. 

## I Thought I Was Like the Universe, but It Turns Out I’m Not That Small

Firstly, forgive yourself   
for caving in a moment,  
and then forgive the moment   
for caving in at all. 

Release the idea that biologically   
you were made for collapsing, and  
adopt the notion that biologically 	  
you were made for blossoming.   

Your destruction is not    
sweeping restoration.

_You are not the big bang._   

Your resurrection     
will still tomorrow    
reliably look like you.  

You don't grow like explosion,  
but like spring.   
You are a seed then a baby,  
then a bud then a blossom,  
and then you are dead again. 

## Incident Report

I make art in fits of self-admonishment  
because I want to make art for you.  

I send diagrams of cavernous regions,  
draw maps of where I hide vacant space,  
you cum inside me and we do not kiss,  
again.   

Instead,  
you bring applesauce  
to my open, open door  
and spoon-feed me tastes  
of what it might feel like  
to be loved by you.  
Snooze the alarm five times,  
crawl back under,  
I am left in mourning,  
again.  

On day of atonement,  
we have drinks at the same bar.  
I spend an hour doing and undoing my hair  
You tell me about a girl you’d like to marry,  
as if you are afraid I will forget I am not the end,  
again.
