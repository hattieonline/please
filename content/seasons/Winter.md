## Lies I Tell About Cancer
Today, I lied about picking my mother up from chemo  
but I wasn't lying about the chemo, my mom is dying,  
and so I have the right to lie  
(down in surrender, but please never let me)

My name is Hattie and I tell lies about cancer and I am afraid of driving because of crashing then dying but I tell others and myself that is not so-- I say that my mother told me I was afraid, and so I was, and so I am.

Lies about cancer that I tell:

-&nbsp;I will be late because I am picking my mother up from chemo  
-&nbsp;Sometimes the best thing you can say is that you don't know what to say  
-&nbsp;I have found solace in the time that we still have left  
-&nbsp;I don't think about how long that time will last  
-&nbsp;I am not afraid

On my quietest days & some alone nights,  
I think about when somebody told me that  
my personal problems (my cancer mom)  
did not absolve me from pain I've caused  
_as if cancer has ever released me_ or  
as if I cradle myself  
as if I could even bear to.   
It reminds me too much of my mother, and me,  
asleep somewhere inside the years between my birth  
and the first time I made her cry--  
somewhere safe that is no longer real,  
but somehow,  
I can still see me, cradled,  
and her, still able to hold me  
still able to protect me  
still my mother.

Still my mother, I become hers.  
Be still, I tell my mother and  
o, how we writhe in the pain  
of never talking about ours

_Are there scholarly articles about the reversion to newborn vulnerability undergone by dying mothers?_ 

My evidence suggests that eventually, the only thing they'll want to be  
is held and I just want to touch the side of her cheek softly  
but she hasn't succumbed — she will not  
admit how badly she needs tenderness.  
She will not succumb to being tender  
with even herself & so neither will I,  
as that would mean surrendering to the beginning of the end  
and _who the fuck wants to imagine getting the last word?_

After we both live forever, she will go out fighting,  
I will go out fighting, we will both go out fighting,  
and when the fight is over, after her dust & drugs have settled,  
I will stand up again, and only then, alone,  
will I admit to needing my mother's love when I am weak

They say it wastes time to worry about when the day will be, but  
I think we waste the most time pretending that we are not afraid,  
that we are too strong to need a hand on our cheek  
_What do I do with my hands and this grief, mom?_

If I am soft with myself  
amidst antemortem mourning,  
I will only see her face.  

If I cry in surrender,  
I will only hear her voice.  

And if I stop writing this poem  
to think about writing this poem,  
my face twists up and my chest implodes  
and everything gets real blurry because  
there are only visions of her still moving,  
and then one of her not,  
and then one of me not,  
and then there is nothing else.

## Non Rom Com Reminders of a Love So Absolute

the touch of love  
tenders my soul  
in the sweetest way, today  


how often i am profoundly changed  
each time i am grounded

is it so scary to be absolutely loved?  
i want to be my best.  

is it so scary to be loved absolutely?  
i look for it in other places.

what if i am not my best?  
you would still love me,  
and that hurts worse.

i want to be my best for you,  
i want to outgrow my growing pains,  
i want to love you through growth spurt hurt  
like you love me even when my hurt hurts you,  
[because, i am still growing]

it's just that you've never stopped raising me  
and it's making me go blind—  
i see bright reds and muted pinks and sunshine yellows,  
i feel your solar warmth, your blinding brightness  
that burns my skin until it peels and i am left  
with this greyed baby blue, this waiting room purple,  
that paints and pours through my body,  
drowns me from the inside,  
consumes me whole,  
and spits me into the pit where [i now know]  
i must sit to assess the damages,  
to put the bones back together,  
to climb out and realize that the pit was a wall,  
that i am closer to the sun than ever  
that soon i will burn again.

do you remember when we went to the emergency room because a swimming pool reflection of the sun gave my hands burns that looked like tree trunks? it was so uncanny.  

they gave me valium and i became so flippant  
that you pleaded me to never do drugs, which i did & do  
which is okay because you did & do more than me,  
which reminds me that i am a seed you planted, worked for, loved absolutely.

I am rooted in you and while I am not afraid of sneaky sunburns or opioid addiction,  
_I am afraid of my flippancy, and I am afraid of how it hurts you._

I want to outgrow my growing pains, but I cannot face my final fear.

<details> <summary> context for you: </summary> 
it's all because i told her that i couldn't sleep in my bed so i've slept on my couch for the past week and as if she had not spent enough on my education and bad credit / attitude, to her own deficit, she came into my home and gave us (my home and i) love like she'd never given, life like it was all she had, and maybe i didn't really realize how badly i need my mother's touch. i am surrounded by so much softness now that i think i will never wake up; i think i may decidedly keep dreaming this exact moment until i am jolted awake with no memory that it happened, either because you forget dreams upon waking or because i will be so waiting room purple that the memory could shatter me to bits. i hope it is because you forget dreams upon waking or because there are new dreams that demand a bit more space [and rightfully so] and given the aforementioned, is poetry a dream journal? in these matrifocal poems, you [not reader, but maker] create me and want me to be something you can revel in, subsequently i lock myself in my sometimes metaphorical room [also done by you], and i lie, and i lay in made-up agony, for a decade, then i turn today years old and you've made my heart into an open wound in the most torturously and naturally beautiful way i think anybody could, and with my spilled guts i create something that i can revel in, that i wish i could give back to you. birth and pain and art and death. it is the truest life cycle, but it is not true to us, even though you would be so proud to hear that I haven't written about a man's love in months, but I can't tell you that, because now my poetry is full of your name, and endings, and feeling small and afraid. and then maybe you'd be proud all over again, because I've pushed through my need for distraction from limitations to get to the core of it, to get to the really gritty part where i start to get pity that i don't want, people telling me they don't know what to say and in return i will scream on our rooftop. i will not lie down. i will not let it change my shape.</details>

_won't it feel so ridiculous when none of this ever comes true,  
to have fixated my renaissance upon loss?_

## Open Letter on Corporate Grief

infantile our dependence on foreign parental entities  
that forge motherhood and the totality of its governance,  
that forgo motherhood and the essential provision of self-concept—  
they tell us unlearned children could never know best,  
but wouldn't i need to ache tremendously and pick it all up  
in order to know what I cannot carry,  
in order to know how to hold

if you never teach a man to fish,  
if you never give him a fish,  
if you tell him there are fish as he lives in the desert,  
he is left at the mercy of your presentation,  
and then he will starve to death.

if the complexity of person-hood  
is as simple as maps, patterns,  
if it may be reduced to a row,  
if we may flux in or out of normalization  
if i do not earn my own trust, and neither do you,  
if intuition is better left programmed,  
will they know how many hours i've logged,  
miscalculating my own dimensionality  
with the wrong measures?

the data analyst shown blueprints of success will surrender sleep  
trying to understand the distance between  
sought metrics and her best day  
and subsequently she will become blind  
to undertones and parallel lines due to  
the sleepless witness borne to others' attainment  
of the key performance indicators set by corporate,  
such as:  
publicized CEO morning routines,  
rent-free twenty threes in a new york equinox class,  
unadulterated camcorder love,  
redemption arcs,  
shakespearean proclamations,  
trust fund manifestation,  
people in glass homes  
devoid of any artifact beyond ease  

_this is what we're running for?_

is it actually self-actualization if it was never really yours?  
if I've never experienced it, did i still see it with my own eyes?  
if i didn't see it with my own eyes, is it still part of my reality?  
do i get to make that choice?

i almost didn't remember  
that this is all i will ever be;  
self-definition through my lacking and my gaps  
is a perilous insult to the woman   
who writes this poem,  
to the day she arrived screaming,  
to the days / women that live in between  
and i almost didn't remember them because right now,  
i am struck dead at the hand of videos of hands, things  
being put away, people doing tasks / living lives that  
i do not recognize, claiming  
they have the way out but  
then being the way in, all  
while never having seen  
my foundation or  
living the days or  
being the women—  
a thousand parallel lines,  
how could they tell me  
to spend my life  
praying for our collision?

if we all fall asleep  
listening to the same distraction,  
will our dreams collide?

## Consummate Creation
1. allowing the self to feel it all  
 (self as inner child,  
 the one that needed to shut up,  
 and so now your voice roars in a way   
 that makes you feel afraid)  
   
    _and what if there is no recoil?_  
 we find it within ourselves, by repeating a rendition of an adult scream  
 in our own voice, with those childlike promises of self-betterment  
 (that really just ask: am i still a person worth loving?)  
 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tip:   
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; answer "YES, YES, YES" your  
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole way home, and cry:  
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the joy of being so wholly loved,  
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for your homecoming  
   
   your chest  
must  
be cavernous,  
    
    it must be  
more   
than numb.  
    
    _you shouldn’t want a drink._  
      
    it should feel so heavy that  
outpour is the only option for redemption  
and reclaim of light-footedness lost.

2. perform rorscharch inkblot test.  
materials include:  
-&nbsp;paintings torn to shreds   
-&nbsp;drawings of (and letters to) ex boyfriends   
&nbsp;&nbsp;that fill you with enough adoration to dig it up  
&nbsp;&nbsp;and enough regret to drown yourself from the inside out,  
-&nbsp;paint that would not have dried  
&nbsp;&nbsp;if your hands were actually meant for making   
-&nbsp;the willingness to search for answers,  
-&nbsp;and discomfort that you've had them all along

3. look for all of your faces.  
trust that you see them,  
that others should see them, too  
    
    give them life even when they do not look like you  
(you are not always a degas subject)  
let them hold and behold each other,  
the cherub should ogle  
at the version of you with  
hands that belong to strangers 
   
   let them gouge your eyes out, and  
let them team up against you, and  
sit to talk it out 

5. listen to what is begging to be heard.  
you cannot live in past glory  
and make beautiful art.  
you must  
wash your face, give yourself space,  
you need  
allowance for, acceptance of  
your innards and the way  
your skin could never  
bleed like this 

5. your feelings must be hurt.  
you must be vulnerable  
enough to get your feelings hurt,  
you must be brave enough  
to call hurt  
as you see it (old friend)  
   
   if it is easy,  
if they think they have felt it before,  
rip it up and  
start over.  
   
   turn off your ears,  
forget that other people have eyes.  
   
   they should squint to see the faces  
they should turn it upside down  
they should find the waldo and  
scream   
   
   your art must terrify you, or else  
you do not create for expression,  
you retell stories with endings that  
they have memorized  
   
   they should look at your art, point to your god, and  
only believe one revelation to be true. they should  
drown in the water of their own baptism and  
be rendered missionaries:  
has there ever been a deity to live inside of eye sockets? 


 ## presence as a preferred indifferent
i am supposed to write but  
i have nothing in me  
it isn’t you, any of you,   
except for the instance:  
i imagine your form outside of my home,  
and i no longer feel so alone.

i understand what it is like when this  
heart is in only my hands — i’ve written it to shreds,  
so much so that there are no remaining words, there is just  
my great love that no longer feels so parasitic.  
do i want for somebody to make a home of me?

i am supposed to write but  
i send you something in spanish  
about how afraid i am of being touched  
for reasons i don’t understand, for   
reasons i don’t understand, and  
you don’t speak spanish,   
y no quiero hablar sobre eso.

## childsplay

the game must be that: i reveal more about me,  
the bits nobody really actually wants to know, and  
i wait like some kind of hungry cat for you to  
*ask*  

but the game is slated to be a losing game, and  
i don’t tell you that, and  
i do that on purpose, and  
i pretend i prefer it that way.   
please, take the warnings and   
go

the next level of the game is:  
will i feel grotesque and  
will you make me feel dramatic  
just like my mom does?  
and will you think   
*of course you have issues with  
your mother, and of course  
you think your body has been violated  
because of course,  
there must be a reason that your  
hot young tight body  
cannot be touched* 

but back to me,   
and you would like to know,  
could you still fuck me?   

i lose the game,   
i return to the previous page,  
you choose a different option  

but then    
what if the space between us is negative   
and one of my legs, two aorta, a hand  
is at fusion with your respective appendages?   
what then?  

what if you stare at me the wrong way?  
what if you sit in front of me and i don’t recognize you?  
even worse: what if you are exactly what i imagined?  
even better: what if you are exactly what i imagined?

## Wrist Chasing and Other Whimsy
_monday night field notes on an evening of imagination: log of shapes found where they did not previously exist, undiscovered glaciers, new ways to measure time, and other observations made in a scheduled stupor at an infinite seven o clock_

i am wearing a combination of my two favorite dresses &  
all of the sudden it is my wedding dress

i do an irish jig,  
i melt into the floor.  
i am sinking,  
i won’t let go.  
it pulls me down,  
i never find who it is.

i am in bloom but it looks like imploding.  
something is skewing. we fall inside and then down.  
it loops through until the thought is right.  
it stops.

the tables no longer matter.  
the pages in front of me are  
lyrics about cosmic love.  
i remember i’ve memorized the song.  
i hide inside of cracks in the voice  
until it collapses under   
an atmospheric pressure.  

the lyrics become message drafts  
they’re texts that are still at work  
they’re spreadsheet analyses of orbit  
they’re lists of my worst qualities  
they justify my profligate,  
in both of our handwriting

_the floor is lava, and we laugh it off like children_

we erupt as hymen, stamen  
we play hooky inside the folds   
of velveteen petal curtains,   
as if we are still seeds.   

i say that i don’t want to get caught defying mother nature.   
you tell me to jump.
