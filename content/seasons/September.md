## September 18th, 2021

i&#39;d prefer to meet the sun before it meets me first and  
i&#39;d like to stand beneath it, warm summer-like and coolly say:

_so imagine we&#39;re you-and-i-whispering to each other about_  
_something or other, maybe god, but at least devout luckiness_

i&#39;d prefer not to care how i write my poetry  
it&#39;s like i&#39;m talking myself into a flow state immersive  
o, pour from my pen / no my type /  
is it because i type that i cannot muster  
a poetic anything? or, conversely

who am i to say that anything is or is not poetic because poetry is  

when i stand beneath a world that towers over me,  
there is a feeling i&#39;ve never felt and at this point  
i&#39;ve felt it enough to know that i can feel it again-- i&#39;ve never not.  
growing up within temporality the trees grew next to me  
but now there is a new place with tree roots of transmutation  
forcing streets into hills pillaging cracks in sidewalks  
these trees are so assertive—

_can they teach me how or have i not come of age yet?_

throw my own debutante ball on the self-designated cleaning day  
i stand in my best dress, study myself poised in the mirror, and i let my  
pencil do all of my talking— o how stern and stoic i look.

_have i aged a bit?_

there are hurricanes in the north east people wade or boat for  
their daily commute the breeze reaches here too with white water  
that explodes down the street as if an airport homecoming con roses  
pour like greeting an old friend ready to attach the hip to the other water bits  
&quot;i&#39;ve missed you since we were in that cloud, has anything changed at all? &quot;

_do i miss being part of something bigger than me?_  
_have i ever been a part of anything bigger than me until now?_

rebirth seems to have everything to do with the atomic level of being or not being:  
&quot;a spark, a particle of old fire, bursts to life again ferociously enough to consume a whole house&quot; or &quot;a flood reminds us that rebirth begins with nurturing even the smallest bits of matter&quot;

oppuestos attract or there is no rebirth without burning it all down  
letting fire consume everything and never extinguishing not until nothing remains  
once thy home is hollowed, queue the outpouring the onslaught the everything  
there is no renewal of what was— just a final blow that knocks the rest  
and the wind out and we shall be left to put the no remaining pieces  
back together as kintsugi and we shall form with our hands new ways to succumb to  
from the untouched scorched fertile giving ground that is  
just ours nobody else&#39;s just ours to decide how to plan this us city--  
i make my own unflawed humanity that kisses me back &amp; makes mistakes,  
for whoever just realizes there doesn&#39;t have to be another side to anything  
some things can just be, and that is the end, and still just the beginning

WHAT I DID TODAY  

---  

i did cut my hair bit by bit  
sometimes how i was supposed to but usually not  
so as to not cut my fingers in the shapes of split ends 

i did cut the back myself, it was hard  
so then i let myself feel tired.  
i indulged some kind of whim   
which reminded me of whim still living   
in the forgettable elsewhere of the everyday

i made a mean foccacia and my personal best alfredo sauce

i did sit in the rain and   
i did realize later that what was actually happening was that i was sad  
but at the time i thought the poem about a mother and her daughter  
was what moved me to tears and  
you can't feel good forever and  
life does humbly remind me of that.

i did beg for creation and i did try for it  
but sometimes there are days that i reread my last moments of ascention  
cuz i'm deperate to remember how i climbed without realizing it  
until i was stuck atop something - i'd like to keep meeting myself  
where i left off but i realize that is not feasible and that you know -  
paths, newness, amnesia, all of it

i did say nothing to some sometimes for some time  
i've got this pivot project where i listen to only the bus  
wade through that which i am knee deep in (  
rain) reminds me that i too can weep and then i do  
and i won't stop until it does but even still  
i love it like source or mother  
as if it gives the permission slip for exploration by extraction-  
dig up something or all inside me & let it be washed  
and after that, most importantly  
i learned that i too can catalyze rebirth,  
and then i could not sleep again, the rain kept going

WHAT I DID TODAY  

---  

i did not run out of things to say  
i did not feel sad in the same way  
but today: rambunction like sons or pining  

i did gorge (daintily) i&#39;m sorry, i secretly and wholly devoured:  
1.&nbsp;two different gas-station-esque snacks in loud bags past 11PM  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_could anybody hear?_  
2.&nbsp;my own words mostly cuz i proposed that you eat my shorts / me,  
&nbsp;&nbsp; and all that blush for what? inspiration that hopefully carries me outta  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_my fingers are still crossed_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Emily is coming over tonight and_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_don&#39;t forget Kate has her presentation tomorrow_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this place with its sudden mold and stalagmite half empties  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which at least is now recognizable &amp; furthermore i understand the mechanics  

i considered the men and then you and then you again but what might be better  
[after self-consideration] is to remind me more of my father please  
not all-knowing Dionysus but he who was before i  
think he used to create all prolifically undone and probably was kind, he  
today loves me in the best way i or anyone could- something like that please  

oh and i showered! unlike ever before as if porously or gutted (good) or like  
all of the dumb poems about you me &amp; catharsis have been wrong (better)  

it stormed and my radishes got fucked and get this, you won&#39;t believe it:  
four armed teenagers took both the corner &amp; the cars by storm and despite that,  
i called ceasefire on my sleep strike, 2-week streak aside, because i suppose  
i do probably want to feel good  
and i do

i promised my mom that i&#39;d call before bed  
but then decided maybe i&#39;d rather see her instead  
because i thought too much about semantics &amp; death  
so i followed her advice &amp; i practiced my breath  
i did as she does and worried myself sick,  
matrifocal dawn turned sorry soporific

WHAT I DID TODAY  

---  

i do not want to write a poem   
i want to work and clean and think about fall fashion  
but i also want to do this project,  
and so, here is what is today:  
it is chilly and my apartment feels different,  
my therapist told me i am not codependent  
yesterday i cleaned two rooms-- it feels amazing,  
and like all adults do, i loved morning meeting.  
i feel good &amp; happy with myself  

-

it is now 6:50 PM and i have been rejected twice today.  
both of them were okay, neither made me sad like you&#39;d think  
on both occasions i loved myself more and never once felt ugly.  
i could even say i feel empowered in being turned down, 

but now it is very quiet, and i know i&#39;m not sad,   
but my heart feels a little in my stomach,  
and i&#39;m not sure why


it feels like i should be doing something social  
since we&#39;re all so excited about the weather  
classic days of plans with no plans feel wrong and   
i am out of paper towels but i already came and went from CVS  
do i need them? what do i need? maybe rich homie quan and half of an adderall  
maybe not the adderall but to at least feel fun so is that a shower? noodles?  
kitchen has to clean first before dinner. what dinner? what paper towels?  
i got a dashboard project today that i&#39;ve wanted for over a year,  
did my makeup during the meeting, and took a golden mirror from the street.  
a lot of good walking today which explains my reluctance to get paper towels  
wouldn&#39;t i have just jumped on that walk usually? that&#39;s ok.  

i can&#39;t be all of the things on all of the days.  
but i will be, and am, thankful that i&#39;m at least doing this thing on this day  

my mom called  
and her voice sounded small  
i know she wants to come be with me  
but i just sit and stall
