## Freytag's Plot Pyramid Without the Climax & Especially With It

_all who make love tonight are good poets_  
but what of all 17 syllables i birthed with formal announcement  
to you, holiest, only to offer another&#39;s iambic offspring as  
my sacred sacrifice for the sake of  
letting you think i am more inspired  
than i am prolific than i am pregnable  
pregnant with a prayer that  
my third grade kiss satisfies  
your student your teacher our  
fight my fright your flight  
to your parents a sacrilegious fuck  
beyond my crooning or my arch or our arc  
who cares of the sloppiness or rightness of fellation  
except me and my rumination and exempt the girl  
i am at night as the daytime shift  
holds her head high but now yours low  
in the dark your words are reticent  
sunlit reverence maybe not made up  
maybe made up maybe made blurry by bibation maybe  
daydreams are clinical coping or maybe they&#39;re just dreams  
as ever since we / i poeticized this whatever it is  
i haven&#39;t slept before dawn in the early mourning   
of your probable preconceptions, i am clockwork awake  
and acquiescent to some guttural premonition  
that orchestrates my grief like a machinated head  
bowed at entr&#39;acte, hanging low below the heart  
as if swelling could still be reduced or induced  
and mostly as if the exposition exposed enough   
to become a resolution with no resolve

## You and I, What Do We Do?
morse code executed by electric existence   
mimicry of adult futures or whatever matrimony  
the back of your head and my loud door as dial tones   
for the poor reception where we sit, ladies in wait,   
men for lust or glory   
intrusion upon, open legs, pointed toes   
leaning back, all for the sake of our   
disinterested interest

i wrote poetry of her bad conversation and my   
rhythmic hallucinations and not  
of the first time we touch never  
our honest moments we don't  
talk about it there is no  
love to talk about, love i wait for  
you like to impress and here i am  
now what?

## We Probably Said a Lot of Weird Things 
small white houses in  
which we raise kids on indie   
music and your whims

six figure mansions   
in the parts of town where all   
hip young parents live

_my husband does law_   
i'd say from a white sundress   
translucent & young

## Not Sonnet at the Restaurant With the Waitress
not like i was eyecontacting anyways  
what would I be saying?  
& what language will it be familiar to?  
is eveybody afraid of unknown integral cogs? 

i have the right & you don't  
now i tell myself i can't & get on  
let down move on, tail-in-leggedly  
anger through can't be poetically on topical

typical of my self apologetical writhing  
about something done to somebody i knew once  
i repeat alone, lists of my most loved parts  
sold to you for tumoltuous sporatics

egging on my escapism from the sidelines  
like some shitty occasional step dad--  
do you like me expressive only conceptually?  
do you know when I dress up for you?



## Ways of Making Love
collapsedly, if it were a word  
it's a trap! think nothing fast— the world depends on it  
nuanced eye squints after i say that thing that i always do   
and winks of the like  
*desperately*  
wound tight, appendage-wise  
as if you don't give a fuck who reads this poem  
as if  you've never checked your work  
millimeters closer at a rate of one per second, so as to bit by bit collide into  
melt slowly in and reach a rolling boil  
ever so slightly, on the right side of my lower back, in passing  
we never feel embarrassed again  
letting silence in  
telling me not to get the arugula   
eating the arugula at the crux of rot  
please get the knot out of my back  
slowly,  
like a cartographer but  
as if this is our night shift  
wait more than 5 minutes for me,   
forcing me to take time  
with as many square inches of skin to skin contact as possible  
like we can't stop trying to recreate the fusion of two black holes or  
we just shouldn't— but i notice every morning when you didn't sleep well  
as if this can't be ever recreated: it's so bright, how could it possibly be described  
i will never have to try to make sense again in my life  
in a bathroom at a house party placebo-molly love-drunk  
pretending it was never about possession  
with our initials are etched on the love trees / whatever our hometowns have  
so tired but we can't *not*  
following a mutually shared accomplishment  
lazily  
in hourly intervals  on the brightest day of the year,  
just to spite  
roleplaying Irish exits  
on the holidays we forget we have off  
like we know the same thing  
we're partners in a card game about to play the hand of a lifetime  
thinking maybe you've never felt anything like this, but  
you know exactly what to do,  
and actually i know what to do too, but i'm acting a little nervous (and i am)  



## GOVERNANCE OVER THE GIRL

MY COMEBACK MY  
NEVER CUMMING  
MY EYE CONTACT &amp;  
AVERSION  
MY RATTLING  
MOUTH MY  
WEED DEPENDENCY  
MY SHITTY  
BEER MY  
MOTHER&#39;S NERVES  
MY FATHER&#39;S NOSE  
MY DECORATIVE  
MEANINGLESS CREATIONS  
MY UNDISCOVERED GLACIER  
&amp; YOUR THIEVING HANDS  

MY SELF-CENTERED  
WORLD WHERE I  
PUT MYSELF FIRST  
AT THE RISK OF  
YOUR DISPLEASURE  
&amp; THE LOSS OF MY NEED  
TO AFFIRM MY RIGHTNESS  
THROUGH YOUR EYES

MY FOWL NEED FOR SECURITY  
&amp; MY ENDEARING FOWL MOUTH  
&amp; THE FACT THAT I BUY FLOWERS  
IN MY BEST DRESSES &amp; THAT  
I&#39;D LIKE TO INTRODUCE SOMEBODY  
TO MY FRIENDS &amp; DON&#39;T HAVE SEX  
FAST ENOUGH &amp; HAVE SEX TOO  
FAST &amp; HAVE SEX TOO LOUD &amp;  
NOT HAVE SEX AND JUST LAUGH.

I DECIDE I AM MY JUDGE &amp;  
THEY CORRAL AROUND ME  
AGAPE BEGGING TO BE  
MY JUDGE AGAIN AS IF  
I SHOULD NOT BE THE JUDGE  
OF MY STILL FOREIGN BODY
