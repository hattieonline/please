### Event Log at the Escapist Palace

1.	We sit on the precipice.  
Behind us the earth pushes forward—slowly, carefully,  
only when we aren't looking.  

2.	On my back is a vortex, and the whole world enters in pairs.  
Two turkeys, two doe, two bucks, two babies,  
and the two of us, bewildered and searching. 
3.	God lives in the ground here, and each of us knows this is true.  
We kiss it with whatever our mouth looks like today.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine: a hand opened, and head bowed.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours: gentle eyes that fall to your knees when the time is right.  

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is always right. We hold hands and succumb in tandem.

4.	A million beds and we three still sit in the corner of one.  
We take turns dripping mirrors, checking if we’ve turned into our mothers yet,  
getting each other high, giving vigilante justice, and grace, and grace, and good god, grace.

5.	Waist deep with danger swimming around my legs, I realize it no longer matters.  
The ocean crashes into me until my only thoughts are strategies for moving over, under, and through. My body is one with. There are no true minutiae. There never was.
6.	We lose the need for lists once encountered with the epiphany that order is for naught. Lights on a switchboard with no rhythm and never an end, you are a flash then nothing then everything in an instance. I am never afraid of the last time I see you. 
7.	Mourning is ingrained into our days, and we are thus jubilant.  
We welcome the end and brace for the beginning, over and over, knowing we will never coexist with the final conclusion and in that, we are melded together for finite forever. 
8.	We laugh at our own hurt feelings when the hummingbirds perform their dance.  
At their apex, our putrid insides roll away. We float into the emptied middle place where we have never been, and yet always are. 
9.	There are no wildflowers because that is not the nature of this.  
The animals do not have enough to eat and houseless chimneys blink back at me—it is not about the beautiful end. It is surviving to the bitter one. 
10.	We enter the houses of all strangers.   
We leave strands of our hair on pillows and in shoes.  
This is how you circumnavigate our new homes, and   
this is my desperate attempt for prolonged isolation.   

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to be taken away forever.   
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to be stripped of my days and left at the mouth of rocky waters.   
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want you to come, too.   
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My exile will rebirth me, where will you be? 




### A day
Last night, I learned how to lucid dream,  
and we soared through the streets.  

You still didn’t remember how much you meant to me,  
so I yanked us out and over to the moment,  
in which I never realized how uncomfortable  
my open heart surgery made you feel. 

I'm sorry.

### Another day
This morning, I woke up without anything to prove.  
I did some mulling over and didn't daydream about you,  
as another graduation, just today on my walk, as I do.

The trees gathered round me, to lean across the hall   
to touch each others spirit fingers, like parents  
after a middle school championship sports game won.  
 
Today we celebrate the rain and  
how it made for a stream  
you cannot help but listen to.  

The stride in my walk,  
the swing dance in my arms,  
the rushing, the onslaught, the   
washing over of contentedness.  

The consummations of a lesson learned.  
The remembrance of the idle mind.  
The unsung fun of undemanded attention.

I ruined another idea by turning it into an Adderall sonnet today,  
an act of martrydom in the name of disjecta membra poetae


  

### you, infiltrator of premises or routine,

i wanted     
to write you   
a letter  
to say  

_how i think letters would make you happy  
which me, makes happy, and as would reading  
out loud. i always want to practice, and now you and  
yet now you. then now you. but now you. i have to read  
every love poem written to compare now holiest you  
to the stars  and then give it back. and now you. now  
you i have to reread all my old words to imagine now   
you imagining me, in a different life, begging   
to know my now you and i didn't even know of the    
breadth or the excitement and do you wanna make pasta?_   

i am threatened  
by abandon  
in every  
good way  


### tell me you'll

how happy you when  
 we held hands to exit  
you felt like what maybe  
i daydream about tell me  
it was the best part tell me  
when you hear my name tell me  
what do you feel? you love my feet  
they're dirty but by no means unloved  
i'm dirty i found it in my mom's search   
history of unlove they're dirty i am but i   
am un abashed loved by best contestant  
you? will you? try? they're calloused you  
don't mind. but i've been places? could we try?

### exit the game
to turn hot blood into teenage angst and  alcohol  
requires at least all vulnerability left in the threads.  

i don’t have it.   

i don’t have the composure, the ability  
to withhold when you need it the most.  

and so, congratulations:  
you broke down the flood barriers  
and I’m coming inside.  

for a coffee, for a glass of wine,   
for appraisal, for a sleepover with   

you tell me of skips in your step  
upon my name, witnessing it  
on me, witnessing it. on my being,  
witnessing it. and then you not of course 

flee the scene, blame the floodgates  
rue them and remove them and remove   
you and ever having been the maybe happy  
ending. i'm sorry.   

i got too excited. i can’t write like i once did or like     
i expect but then maybe i expected you but can you   
blame me? i blame you, blame your idealization and   
devalue me because i gave in, because your fuck you  
removal. you wanna read my writing?  
i won't speak.  

six months from now i will forget you  
unlike what you said it’d be   
six days from now i will forget you   
unlike some weekend plan with me     

is it cuz i was barefoot?  
is it cuz of the chewed up gum?  
is it the drugs?  

i’ll stop in the name of   
love but not yours
